<p>Social media is a powerful way for people to connect and share information online, 
  and it significantly influences how we live our lives. One of the primary advantages is global
  connectivity as it increases social interaction since people can communicate with their friends,
  relatives and helps to build relationships even when they are far away. Additionally, social media 
  is a great platform for sharing information and stay updated with news and trends in real time.
  Moreover, it also encourages creative expression, providing a space for users to share their photos, videos, and ideas.
