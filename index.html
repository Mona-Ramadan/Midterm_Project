    <h1>Arguments against Social Media</h1>

    <section id="against">
      <h2>Mental and Social Impact:</h2>
      <p>
        Social media can greatly affect people’s mental health. It can increase
        anxiety and depression due to social comparisons and feelings of
        isolation. People often see idealized versions of others’ lives, which
        can make them feel unhappy with their own. Additionally, excessive use
        of social media can harm real-life relationships because people might
        prioritize virtual interactions over face-to-face communication, leading
        to a sense of loneliness and disconnection from the real world.

      <h2>Addiction and Distraction:</h2>
      <p>
        Social media is very addictive, and people often spend hours on it
        without a clear purpose. This addiction can lead to distraction and
        lower productivity at work or school. The constant notifications and the
        urge to check updates can interrupt important tasks, making it hard to
        focus. Over time, this can result in poor time management and a decrease
        in the quality of work or study, as individuals struggle to balance
        their online and offline lives.

      <h2>Spread of Misinformation:</h2>
      <p>
        Social media helps spread fake news and misleading information quickly.
        This can lead to people forming incorrect opinions and making decisions
        based on inaccurate information, which affects society as a whole.
        Misinformation can cause panic and harm public health, as seen with the
        spread of false information about vaccines. The rapid dissemination of
        such content makes it challenging to correct false narratives, leading
        to long-term misconceptions and distrust in reliable sources.

      <h2>Privacy and Security:</h2>
      <p>
        Privacy is a major challenge for social media users. Personal
        information can be hacked or misused, exposing individuals to risks like
        cyber theft and blackmail. Many users are unaware of how much data they
        share online, which can be exploited by malicious actors. Additionally,
        social media platforms often collect and sell user data to third
        parties, raising concerns about consent and the potential misuse of
        personal information. This lack of privacy can lead to serious
        consequences, including identity theft and financial loss.
